# K-Means algorithm Data Mining
This is a very widely used algorithm in data mining.

I have created an implementation of the algorithm and a tester java file with which you can see if your program will pass all the test cases. 

Included in this repository is the "iris.txt" file which contains all the data that I am performing the implementation of the algotithm on.
